# 👋🏻 Hey, I'm AJ!

I'm a 33-year-old Brazilian developer with over 12 years of experience crafting robust web applications and digital products. Passionate about solving complex problems, I strive to deliver meaningful, user-focused solutions through clean architecture and thoughtful code.

Over the last 8 years, I've specialized in *Laravel*, building scalable and maintainable systems across the full software lifecycle — from planning and architecture to deployment, performance optimization, and long-term support.
